# VeriRego

**VerRego** is a tool for formal verification of [Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/) policies using SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solving and symbolic execution. It aims to provide confidence in policy correctness by automatically checking properties, detecting inconsistencies, and finding potential policy violations before deployment.
